# Extraction accuracy report

_Generated: 2026-04-24T01:00:11.611Z_
_Model: `gemini-3-flash-preview`_
_Fixtures root: `fixtures/` — see [fixtures/README.md](../fixtures/README.md) for provenance, schema, and the Day-1 curation backlog._

> **Baseline-only:** Every ground-truth field in this run is empty/zero (blank IRS forms). Field accuracy here measures schema conformance, not real extraction quality. See [fixtures/README.md](../fixtures/README.md) "Day-1 curation backlog" for the filled-fixture TODO.

## Summary

| Doc type    | Fixtures | Classification | Field accuracy |
| ----------- | -------- | -------------- | -------------- |
| `w2`        | 1        | 1/1 (100.0%)   | 10/10 (100.0%) |
| `1099_nec`  | 1        | 1/1 (100.0%)   | 6/6 (100.0%)   |
| `1099_misc` | 1        | 1/1 (100.0%)   | 8/8 (100.0%)   |
| `k1`        | 1        | 1/1 (100.0%)   | 8/8 (100.0%)   |

Mean per-field self-reported confidence across fixtures: **1.00**. A value close to 1.00 on a blank-fixture baseline indicates the model is not penalizing confidence for empty boxes — this is expected for blank forms but would be a calibration red flag if it persists on filled fixtures.

## K-1 inclusion decision

K-1 decision deferred — K-1 fixtures are still blank baselines (100.0% trivially). Re-run after filled K-1 fixtures land; if accuracy stays < 80%, drop K-1 from `src/lib/extraction/types.ts`/`schemas.ts` and propagate to U14 (CSV export).

## Recommended thresholds

- `CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD`: **0.85**
- `DOC_TYPE_THRESHOLD`: **0.70**

Rationale:

- Zero field errors across fixtures — keeping the origin default 0.85 for CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD until filled fixtures land.
- Doc-type classification was 100% across fixtures — keeping DOC_TYPE_THRESHOLD at 0.70.

## Threshold sweep

Per-field confidence from all fixtures. "Flagged" = fields where the model's self-reported confidence was below the threshold. Precision/recall measure whether the threshold cleanly separates errors from correct extractions — high recall means the threshold catches most errors; high precision means most flags actually are errors.

| Threshold | Flagged fields | Flagged errors / Total errors | Precision | Recall |
| --------- | -------------- | ----------------------------- | --------- | ------ |
| 0.70      | 0              | 0/0                           | N/A       | N/A    |
| 0.80      | 0              | 0/0                           | N/A       | N/A    |
| 0.85      | 0              | 0/0                           | N/A       | N/A    |
| 0.90      | 0              | 0/0                           | N/A       | N/A    |

## Known limitations

- Baseline fixtures are blank IRS forms; see [fixtures/README.md](../fixtures/README.md) "Day-1 curation backlog" for the filled-fixture TODO that gates the ≥ 90% success criterion.
- `_note` keys in ground-truth files are ignored by the harness; they exist to document fixture provenance alongside the expected values.
